# Local-Adventurer
An emulation based system for distributed file storage and parallel computation.

The main objective of this project is to
1. Build an emulated distributed file system (EDFS) using MySQL.
2. Implement partition-based map and reduce (PMR) on data stored on EDFS for
search/analytics function.
3. Create an app for searching and analyzing the data stored in EDFS using the functions
implemented using PMR.
